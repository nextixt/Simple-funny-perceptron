# ðŸ¤–Funny perceptron sandbox

This is a neural network that:
- Learns without gradients.
- Works on pure intuition (and randomness).
- Predicts in such a way that even it doesn't understand how.
P.S You can also use it as sandbox for your experiments, you can modify learning parameters, and just having a good time!

My perceptron is faster than GPT-4 because:

It does not require a GPU.

It does not use transformers.

It is not ashamed of its mistakes.
