# ðŸ¤–Funny perceptron sandbox

This is a neural network that:
- Learns without gradients.
- Works on pure intuition (and randomness).
- Predicts in such a way that even it doesn't understand how.
P.S You can also use it as sandbox for your experiments, you can modify learning parameters, and just have a good time!
